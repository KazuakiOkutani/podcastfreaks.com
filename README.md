## Build Setup

``` bash
yarn
yarn pregenerate # Download assets into /static/downloads
yarn dev
```

**Use 'yarn' instead of 'npm' because it will cause problem on travis ci when you use 'npm'.**

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn run build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn run generate
```
